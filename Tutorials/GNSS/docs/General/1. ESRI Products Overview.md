# AGOL and Portal and ArcGIS Pro Overview

## ArcGIS Online
_The NPS is consolidating its web GIS platform to ArcGIS Portal._

## ArcGIS Portal
ArcGIS Portal (Portal for ArcGIS) is an on-premises web GIS platform that allows organizations to manage and share GIS resources within their own infrastructure. It provides similar capabilities to ArcGIS Online but is hosted on the organization's servers. Key features include:

* Secure Environment: Host GIS data and services within the organization's network.
* Customizable: Tailor the portal to meet specific organizational needs.
* Integration: Integrate with other enterprise systems and ArcGIS products.
* Collaboration: Share maps, apps, and data securely within the organization.

### Roles and privileges
What organization members can do on ArcGIS Portal depends on your roles and privileges. Roles and privileges are used to control access to resources and capabilities within the portal. Organizations can maintain control over sensitive data and resources by assigning appropriate roles and privileges to users, so they have the necessary access to perform their tasks.

## ArcGIS Pro
ArcGIS Pro is a desktop GIS application that provides advanced tools for spatial analysis, data management, and map creation. It is part of the ArcGIS suite and integrates with both ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Portal. Key features include:
* 3D Visualization: Create and analyze 3D data and scenes.
* Advanced Analysis: Perform complex spatial analysis and geoprocessing tasks.
* Data Management: Manage and edit spatial data in various formats.
* Integration: Seamlessly integrate with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Portal for data sharing and collaboration.
* These three components work together to provide a comprehensive GIS solution, allowing users to leverage the power of cloud-based, on-premises, and desktop GIS tools.


## ArcGIS Field Maps and Survey123

### ArcGIS Field Maps vs Survey 123 vs Collector

ArcGIS Field Maps and Survey123 and Collector applications are used for field data collection. ArcGIS Collector and ArcGIS Field Maps are more map-centric and suitable for spatial data collection, whereas ArcGIS Survey123 is form-centric and ideal for structured surveys and inspections. ArcGIS Field Maps is a more integrated solution that combines the functionalities of multiple apps, including ArcGIS Collector. In this training, we cover Field Maps and Survey123
