# Build a Geodatabase

## STEP 1: Connect to necessary folders and databases

Setting up connections to toolboxes, databases, folders, styles, layouts, etc. will help streamline your data management workflows. Recall that when creating an ArcGIS Pro Project, an empty toolbox and empty geodatabase are also created.

1. If not already open, open ArcGIS Pro and open the MyFieldData project.

2. In the Catalog pane, in the Project tab, right-click Toolboxes then Add Toolbox. Navigate to your working folder/Tools and select Data Standards Toolbox.pyt. Click OK. Repeat this for the Download Attachments toolbox we’ll use in later exercises.

3. In the Catalog pane, in the Project tab, right-click Folders then Add Folder Connection. Navigate to your working folder and select Training Materials. Click OK.

4. Click the insert tab . Under the Styles group, click Add . click Add Style. Navigate to the working folder/Styles select the nps-symbols_2.0.0.stylx and click OK. If prompted to upgrade the style file, click OK.

## STEP 2: Importing shapefiles into a Geodatabase
Review the advantages to managing geospatial data in file geodatabases rather than in shapefiles. This data model is implemented in the Park GIS Data Structure recommended by IMR GIS.
  ✅Make sure the PARK Overview map view from Exercise 2 has been closed within the Pro Project.

1. Click on the Analysis tab then click the Tools button in the Geoprocessing group.

2. In the Find Tools box of the Geoprocessing pane, type Feature Class to Feature Class into the search bar.
     Figure 28: Geoprocessing pane with “feature class to feature class” typed into the search bar.

6. Click the Feature Class to Feature Class tool at the top of the search results.

7. Next to the Input Features field at the top of the tool, click the folder button . Navigate to the working folder/Data then select the PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_ParkingLots_py.shp. Click OK.

8. The Output Location field will be pre-populated with the MyFieldData.gdb that was created at the start of the exercise upon the creation of this Pro Project.

9. In the Output Name field, enter PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_ParkingLots_py_Un.
       ✅Remember to name your new feature class using your park unit code.
       ✅The “Un” indicates the data is not in the correct geographic coordinate system.

      ✅Once the tool finishes, the new feature class will be added to the map layout and the feature class will now be in the MyFieldData geodatabase. 8. From the Geoprocessing pane, click the Back button.

11. In the search box, enter Project and select the Project tool.
         Figure 30: The Project tool used to assign a coordinate system to the new feature class.

12. In the Input Dataset or Feature Class box, use the drop-down to select the PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_ParkingLots_py_un layer. In the Output Dataset or Feature Class box, keep the default location (MyFieldData.gdb) and name the layer PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_ParkingLots_py. Navigate to the appropriate geographic coordinate system by clicking the globe then Projected Coordinate Systems -> UTM -> North America -> NAD 1983 (2011) UTM ZoneXX. Choose the UTM zone for your current location. Refer to image in your working folder/Images or this interactive web map. Click OK.

      Figure 33: (Above) Layer “Alias” name changed inside the feature layer’s property table.

16. In the Catalog pane, right-click PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_ParkingLots_py and select Add to Current Map. Click the Map view.
      ✓ The renamed ParkingLots_py layer is added to the map and appears in the Contents pane.

## STEP 3: Create point feature class for GNSS data collection

1. In the **Geoprocessing** pane, click the back button then search for **Create Feature** and select the **Create Feature Class** tool. 

2. In the **Create Feature Class** tool, set the following parameters: 

   > __Feature Class Location__: MyFieldData.gdb
   >
   > __Feature Class Name__: PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt
   >
   > __Geometry Type__: Point
   >
   > __Template Datasets__: _blank_
   >
   > __OID Type__: Same as template
   >
   > __Has M__: No
   >
   > __Has Z__: No
   >
   > __Coordinate System__:  GCS_NAD_1983_2011
   >
   > __Feature Class Alias__: Trailhead_pt

3. Click **Run**     at the bottom of the “Create Feature Class” geoprocessing tool. When the feature class is successfully     created, **close** (**X**) the Geoprocessing pane to view     the Catalog pane.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Creating a new feature class will not include any data, rather will be used to collect point data later in the training. 

## STEP 4: Create metadata for new feature class

Users will now complete the metadata details for the Trailhead feature class. Completing the metadata is a good practice and the information will be automatically included while sharing layers. 

1. Click **View** in the top navigation pane and then click **Catalog View.**

2. In the Catalog View tab (image below), click **Databases** and then double-click **MyFieldData.gdb**. Select the **PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt** feature class. See the **Metadata**.

   ![arcgispro_catalog_view_tab](..\assets\arcgispro_catalog_view_tab.jpg)

3. In the top of navigation pane, **Catalog** tab is selected. Click __Edit__ in **_Metadata_** group.

   ![arcgispro_edit_metadata_button](..\assets\arcgispro_edit_metadata_button.png)
   
   > [!NOTE] 
   >
   > There are boxes highlighted in red. These fields are **required** to be compliant with the FGDC CSDGM Metadata standards. Use [*this*](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/metadata/create-fgdc-csdgm-metadata.htm)[ ](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/metadata/create-fgdc-csdgm-metadata.htm)link to learn more about completing the FGDC CSDGM Metadata. Metadata can be saved without a green check for each item; **however,** it is best practice to fill out as much as possible.
   
   ![arcgispro_metadata_required_warnings](..\assets\arcgispro_metadata_required_warnings.png)

4. In the **Item Description**, fill out as following:

   > **Title:** PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt  
   >
   > **Tags:** PARK, data collection, transportation, training
   >
   > **Summary**: Point feature class for collecting trailhead location data.
   >
   > **Description:** The point feature class hosts descriptions on trailhead location data collected in the field. Attribute fields include Feature Name, Feature Type, Public Display, Data Access, Unit Code, Unit Name, Group Code, Group Name, Region Code, Create Date, Create User, Edit Date, Edit User, Map Method, Map Source, Source Date, XY Accuracy, Geometry ID, and Notes.
   >
   > **Credit:** Maintenance, Facilities, PARK, National Park Service

5. Click **New Use Limitation**.

   > **Use Limitation**: These data exist to assist park staff maintain trailhead asset information. This data may not be appropriate for public consumption.

6. Set **Appropriate Scale Range** for the layer.

7. Leave the **Bounding Box** blank. 

8. From the **Metadata** tab, in the **Manage Metadata** group, click **Save**.

   > Check ✅: *Select the **PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt** feature class in the **Catalog** view. The updated metadata can be seen to the right of the highlighted layer.*

10. **Close** the **PARK_TRANS_TRANING_Trailhead_pt** metadata view. 

## STEP 5: Design attribute fields

In this step, users will create two attribute fields for the Trailhead layer: Feature Name and Feature Type.

1. In the Catalog view, right-click **PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt**, point to **Design** and then click **Fields**.

   <!--%% Add image-->

2. On the **Fields** Tab, in the Changes group, click the **New Field** icon.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > ObjectID and Shape are required fields that are automatically generated in every feature class. They will be greyed out.

3. Left click the “Click here to add new field.” Enter the field information for the first attribute in the form (Feature Name):

   > **Field Name:** FEATURENAME
   >
   > **Alias:** Feature Name
   >
   > **Data Type:** Text
   >
   > **Allow NULL:** check (yes)
   >
   > **Length:** 50

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Aliases cannot exceed 30 characters.

4. Add a new field and enter the field information for the second attribute in the form (Feature Type):

   > **Field Name:** FEATURETYPE
   > **Alias:** Feature Type
   > **Data Type:** Text
   > **Allow NULL:** Check (Yes)
   > **Length:** 50

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > Limit the length of text by limiting values only the necessary length.

5. Check over work, **Save** changes, close the **Fields** view , and the **Catalog** view . In the Quick Access Toolbar, click the **Save Project** button to save the project.

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If **Save** is greyed out in the Changes group on the **Fields** tab, click on the Map view, then the **Edit** tab, then **Save** in the Manage Edits group. This will release the lock on the schema changes to the Trailhead_pt layer. Click the **Fields** view and **Save** the changes.

## STEP 6: Create geodatabase domains

Choosing attribute values from a list improves overall data quality and increases data collection efficiency. The attribute field and the domain must have the same data type (ex. Text). Next, create the Feature Type geodatabase domain, then assign that domain to the Feature Type attribute field later in Step 7.

1. In the **Catalog** pane, on the **Project** tab, under Databases, right-click **MyFieldData.gdb** and select **Domains**.

   <!--%% Add Image-->

2. In the Domains view, in the first row, enter the following information:
   > **Domain Name:** FEATURETYPE
   > **Description:** Feature Type
   > **Field Type:** Text
   > **Domain Type:** Coded Value Domain

   <!--%% Add image-->
3. In the grid on the right of the Domains view, type the code and descriptions according to the image below. Review work and correct any spelling errors.
   %% Add Image

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > A green cell to the left of a row indicates unsaved changes. A red cell indicates that there is an error that must be corrected before changes can be saved.
   > ✅At least one coded value and description must be entered for a **Coded Value Domain**. No value or description cell may be left blank.
   > ✅To delete an unwanted coded value or domain, select the row, then click **Delete** in the **Domains** tab, **Clipboard** group.
   > ✅Empty cells within the domain list cannot be deleted.

4. **Save** changes and Close the **Fields** view . In the Quick Access Toolbar, click the **Save button** to save the project.

## STEP 7: Add Core Standard and GNSS metadata fields

We will now add on the NPS Core Standard metadata fields. These fields provide feature level metadata and help future users of the data understand the data’s integrity. At this time, NPS data standards exist for roads, trails, buildings, and cultural resources and should be used for those feature types. For any other feature types, using the Core Standard metadata fields is a best practice.

1. In the **Catalog** pane, on the **Project** tab, open the **Toolboxes** folder, open **Data Standards Toolbox.pyt** and double-click the **Add Fields** and **Assign Domains** script.

2. In the Reference Feature Class box, browse to your working *folder\Standards\NPS_CORE_20160810*. Double-click on the *NPS_CORE_20160810.gdb* and select *CORE_pt.* Click OK.

3. In the **Target Feature Class** box, browse to and double-click on *MyFieldData.gdb*. Select *PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt* and click **OK**.

4. In the **Manage Existing Fields** box, select **Modify Field**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > The Manage Existing Fields box defines the method for handling existing fields in the target feature class. The Modify Field option will modify or change the fields to match the source feature class. If the field cannot be modified, it will be renamed, and a new field will be added. The Rename Field option will rename the existing fields with a _Timestamp. The Ignore Field option will ignore existing fields with the same name and only add missing fields.

   <!--Add Image-->

5. Click **Run** at the bottom of the pane.

6. When the **Add Fields** and **Assign Domains** tool has successfully completed, if still open close the **Catalog** view . **Save** the project.

## STEP 8: Assign domains and standardize fields

1. In the **Catalog** pane, in the *MyFieldData.gdb*, right-click *PARK_TRANS_TRAINING_Trailhead_pt* and select **Data Design** then **Fields**.

2. Assign the FEATURETYPE domain to the Feature Type domain field by clicking in the column for field and selecting FEATURETYPE from the drop-down.
     <!--Add image-->

3. Check to ensure the domains are assigned to the Core Standard fields. They should be assigned as shown in the figure below in step 4.

4. To make data collection more time efficient in the field, assign default values to certain fields. These fields can be changed while out collecting data if necessary. As most data collectors will be within one park unit, in the Default column, type in your Unit Code. Next, repeat this for Unit Name. Then add IMR for the Region Code default value. This exercise uses non-differentially corrected GPS receivers to collect data, so assign the Map Method column the default Autonomous GPS and for Map Source the default Samsung Tab Active 2. In the tool ribbon at the top of ArcGIS Pro, click Save in the Changes group.

   <!--Add image-->

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Currently, Field Maps does not support GNSS metadata for lines or polygons. This document will be updated when support for lines and polygons becomes available.

5. In the Geoprocessing pane, (if the Geoprocessing pane is not already open, open it by clicking into the View tab and then click the Geoprocessing icon), click the back button . In the Find Tools box, type GPS. Select the Add GPS Metadata Fields tool.
    <!--Add Image-->

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > This tool is only available in the ArcPro 2.3+.

6. In the Input Point Features drop-down, select Trailhead_pt. Click Run.
	✅The GNSS metadata fields were added to the Trailhead Point layer.
	
7. **Save Fields** edits and close the **Fields** view.
8. **Save** the project

The project is now ready to share to  Portal. If continuing to the next exercise, keep the MyFieldData project open.
