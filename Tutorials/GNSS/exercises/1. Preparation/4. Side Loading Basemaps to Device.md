# Side Loading Basemaps to Device

In this exercise, users will create a tile package in ArcGIS Pro, add the tile package to your mobile device, and configure your Web Map in AGOL/Portal to use the tile package as the basemap in Field Maps.

**Purpose:** This exercise allows for users with limited internet connection to have basemap imagery in Field Maps when collecting data in the field with no internet connection. In Field Maps, an offline area can be downloaded with internet connection, however this often takes a long time to create the area or fails to download. Side loading a basemap directly to the device bypasses issues with connectivity and is a best practice for field data collection.

**Estimated Completion Time: 45 mins**

To complete this exercise, users will need:

1. Portal Account
2. A Samsung Tab Active 2 (or equivalent) with the NPS Data Collection STIG configured
3. ArcGIS Field Maps
4. An internet connection
