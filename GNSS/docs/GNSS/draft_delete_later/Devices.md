# GNSS Devices for Training

## EOS

Mobile internet connection required.

### Antenna

### EOS Gold (RTK GNSS receiver )

https://eos-gnss.com/products/hardware/arrow-gold

* 1 cm accuracy with RTK
* 10-15 cm accuracy with Galileo HAS
* 4 cm accuracy worldwide w/ Atlas® subscription
* Retain RTK in poor cell areas with SafeRTK®
* Access all GNSS constellations and signals
* Easily integrate with any mobile app
* Compatible with all mobile devices

### EOS Tools Pro  (Software)

https://eos-gnss.com/products/software/eos-tools-pro

* Mobile workers monitor GNSS metadata in real time.
* Facilitates connections to RTK networks and base stations via its built-in NTRIP client.
* Configurable alarms and real-time GEOID height conversions.
* EOS Tools Pro does not collect data. We will use ArcGIS Field Maps for data collection.



## Leica

### Zeno GG04 plus Smart Antenna

Precise point positioning (PPP)

- Achieve high accuracy data collection without a mobile data connection
- Available anywhere in the world, anytime
- Removes reliance on post-processing

### Zeno Mobile (Software)

* Mobile data collection app. Use with GNSS receiver such as  GG04 Plus and FLX100.
* Capture point, line, and polygon data with centimeter accuracy.

### Zeno Connect (Software)

* Configure your Leica receiver and use real-time connection source.
* Collect with third-party mapping apps such as ArcGIS Field Maps.

# NPS Common Workflow

Rule of thumbs

* There is no need for post-processing kinematics when real-time correction is available.
* Collect raw data when real-time correction is unavailable in the field for post processing the data after getting back to the office.
* Use Leica SmartLink Precise Point Positioning (PPP) when internet connection is unavailable or unreliable but require real-time and high accuracy data collection is required.
* Post-processing for mobile data collection for the accuracy.
