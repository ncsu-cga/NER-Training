# Part 2: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)

## How GNSS Works
* As GNSS require minimum of 4 satellites to calculate the position, 3 satellites for a location and 4th satellite for time synchronization. The more satellites the better the accuracy. *For more info ‚ÑπÔ∏è a, b, c.*

* The satellites are in the orbit and the signals are transmitted to the GNSS receiver on the ground. *For more info ‚ÑπÔ∏è d.*

* The receiver calculates the distance to each satellite based on the time it takes for the signal to reach the 
receiver.</br>
    >**Distance** = **Speed of light** (300,000km/s) x **Time** (taken for signal to travel from satellite to receiver)</br>
* The receiver then uses this information to determine its position on the Earth's surface. The accuracy of the position depends on the number of satellites, the geometry of the satellites, and the quality of the signals.

## GNSS Error Sources
Several factors can affect positioning accuracy, including satellite clocks, obituaries, atmospheric conditions, receiver noise, and multipaths.

# GNSS Argumentations
Augmenting a GNSS correct errors and enhances its performance in terms of **_accuracy_**, **_reliability_**, and **_availability_** by incorporating external information into the user's position solution.

## Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS)
SBAS are GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) systems receive correction information from the control segment and transmit it to user segments.

### Implemented SBAS services
* Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) (United States)
* European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) (European Space Agency)
* BeiDou Satellite-Based Augmentation System (BDSBAS) (China)

‚ÑπÔ∏è *Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS)*<br>
*GBAS was initially referred to as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Networks of GBAS use VHF or UHF frequencies and provide localized reception within tens of kilometres of receivers and it is primarily used in aviation purposes.

## Methods Used to Improve GNSS Accuracy
Generally GNSS accuracy is 2-10 meters depending on the number of satellites and the geometry of the satellites, 
but approximately 2 meters. However, there are methods to improve centimeter accuracy.
* Differential GNSS (DGNSS)
* Real-Time Kinetic (RTK) positioning
* Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
* PPP-RTK
* Post-Processed Kinematic (PPK) positioning

### Differential GNSS (DGNSS)
* Utilizes ```pseudorange``` measurements to calculate the difference between the measured distance and the known distance to the satellite.
* A single, standalone base station and a rover and communication link between them.

### Real-Time Kinetic (RTK) positioning
* Utilizes ```carrier range``` mesurements to calculate the difference between the measured distance and the known distance to the satellite.
* Choice of ```local RTK``` or ```network RTK```.
  * **Local RTK**: a single, standalone base station and a rover and communication link between them.
  * **Network RTK**: Essentially the network RTK refers to the Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP) service. 
    * Free NTRIP services such as [NOAA CORS](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/UFCORS/) available in some states in the US.
    * NPS NTRIP - [https://www.gps.gov/cgsic/meetings/2021/smith.pdf](https://www.gps.gov/cgsic/meetings/2021/smith.pdf)
    * Subscription-based NTRIP services such as [Leica SmartLink](https://leica-geosystems.com/en-us/products/gnss-systems/smart-antennas/leica-viva-gs16/life-beyond-traditional-rtk-satellite-based-precise-point-positioning)

#### Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP)

NTRIP is a protocol designed to stream GNSS correction data over the internet for Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning. It is built on the HTTP/1.1 protocol and optimized for integration with RTK correction services.<br>

Key components of NTRIP include:  

- Server: Streams GNSS data to the NTRIP Caster.
- Caster: Acts as a relay, distributing data from the NTRIP Server to multiple NTRIP Clients.
- Client: Receives GNSS data from the NTRIP Caster for use in real-time applications.
- NTRIP uses standard internet protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) and is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for use over various types of internet connections.

**Q: What is RTCM?**<br>
Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) is a non-profit international standards organization. RTCM has released internationally recognized standards for 

- maritime navigation, 
- communication equipment, 
- distress alert systems, and 
- satellite positioning technologies like GPS. 

These standards support various fields, including 

- transportation, 
- surveying, geodesy, 
- precision agriculture, and 
- autonomous vehicles, 


# Precise Point Positioning (PPP)
* Uses a global network of GNSS stations for precise 
satellite orbits and clock corrections and broadcast directory 
from satellites to GNSS receivers achieving centimeter-level 
accuracy. 
* Ideal for high-precision positioning in remote or 
challenging environments where RTK corrections are unavailable. 
* PPP can also be used with RTK to enhance accuracy and provide 
redundancy in critical applications (PPP-RTK)
