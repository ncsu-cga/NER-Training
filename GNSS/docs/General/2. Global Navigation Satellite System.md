# Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)

## GPS vs GNSS
GPS (Global Positioning System) and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) are both satellite-based navigation systems, but they have some differences.

### GPS:

* Developed and maintained by the United States.
* Consists of a constellation of at least 24 satellites.
* Provides global coverage.
* Primarily used for navigation, mapping, and timing.

### GNSS:
* A broader term that includes all satellite navigation systems.
* Includes GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (European Union), BeiDou (China), and others.
* Provides more satellites and better coverage, especially in challenging environments.
* Offers improved accuracy and reliability by combining signals from multiple systems.

### When to use:
* **GPS** - When you need a reliable, widely supported system for general navigation and location services.
* **GNSS** - When you need higher accuracy, redundancy, and reliability, especially in professional or critical applications.
